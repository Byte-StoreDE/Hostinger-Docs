### What are modules?

Modules are extensions for the functions of Hostinger. There are free and bound extensions.

Free extensions have no specifications and contain their own web routes.

Bound extensions are also known as providers; they create an adapter between a function and a module.

For example, the [machine extension](Machine-module.topic) feeds the core system with relevant status information such
as CPU, RAM or disk usage.

### How to install modules?

Modules can be installed manually via the **modules folder** or via the **Module Store**.

The Modules folder is located in the **root directory** of Hostinger under ``modules``

#### Upload Plugin

<note>
Since 1.1.65 you can directly upload plugins via the Web UI.
